    Sometimes you want to add a elements to your website before you know where they will link.

    This is also handy when you're changing the behavior of a link using JavaScript, which we'll learn about later.

    The current value of the href attribute is a link that points to "http://freecatphotoapp.com". 
    Replace the href attribute value with a #, also known as a hash symbol, to create a dead link.

    For example: href="#"
